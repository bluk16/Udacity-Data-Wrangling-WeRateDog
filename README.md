# Udacity WeRateDog Project

In this project, I gather data from multiple sources including web and library.
I performed data assessment, cleaning and visualization on the gathered data files. Lastly, I wrote 2 reports on my wrangling  and analysis effort.

This wrangling process was done in Python using libraries including Pandas, tweepy, requests, matplotlib, numpy.
The software I used includes Jupyter Notebook and MS Word.
